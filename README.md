# MODERN REACT WEB APP BOILERPLATE

A React app boilerplate leveraging the latest technology stack for performant, responsive web apps.  Currently incorporating TODO application code for example.

## FRAMEWORK

### CORE

#### React
[https://facebook.github.io/react](https://facebook.github.io/react)

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

### STATE MANAGEMENT

#### Redux
[http://redux.js.org](http://redux.js.org)

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

### OFFLINE

#### Redux Offline

[https://github.com/jevakallio/redux-offline](https://github.com/jevakallio/redux-offline)

Persistent Redux store for Reasonaboutable:tm: Offline-First applications, with first-class support for optimistic UI. Use with React, React Native, or as standalone state container for any web app.

## BUILD CHAIN

### WEBPACK

[https://webpack.js.org](https://webpack.js.org)

A bundler for javascript and friends. Packs many modules into a few bundled assets. Code Splitting allows to load parts for the application on demand. Through "loaders," modules can be CommonJs, AMD, ES6 modules, CSS, Images, JSON, Coffeescript, LESS, ... and your custom stuff.

## LINTING

### JAVASCRIPT

[http://eslint.org](http://eslint.org)

ESLint is an open source project originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Its goal is to provide a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript.

### CSS

[https://stylelint.io](https://stylelint.io)

A mighty, modern CSS linter that helps you enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your stylesheets.

## AUTOMATED DOCUMENTATION

### JAVASCRIPT

#### JSDoc
[http://usejsdoc.org](http://usejsdoc.org)

JSDoc 3 is an API documentation generator for JavaScript, similar to Javadoc or phpDocumentor. You add documentation comments directly to your source code, right alongside the code itself. The JSDoc tool will scan your source code and generate an HTML documentation website for you.

## TESTING

### UNIT TESTING

#### Mocha

[https://mochajs.org](https://mochajs.org)

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. 
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases

#### Chai

[http://chaijs.com](http://chaijs.com)

Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

#### Redux Mock Store

[http://arnaudbenard.com/redux-mock-store](http://arnaudbenard.com/redux-mock-store)

A mock store for your testing your redux async action creators and middleware

#### Nock

[https://github.com/node-nock/nock](https://github.com/node-nock/nock)

HTTP mocking and expectations library

#### Enzyme

[https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

#### JSDom Global

[https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)

A JavaScript implementation of the WHATWG DOM and HTML standards, for use with Node.js.

#### Mock Socket

[https://github.com/thoov/mock-socket](https://github.com/thoov/mock-socket)

Javascript mocking library for websockets and socket.io

### FUNCTIONAL TESTING

#### Webdriver IO

[http://webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io)

WebDriver bindings for Node.js

#### WDIO Selenium Standalone Service

[https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-selenium-standalone-service](https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-selenium-standalone-service)

This service helps you to run Selenium seamlessly when running tests with the WDIO testrunner. It uses the well known selenium-standalone NPM package that automatically setups the standalone server and all required driver for you.

#### Selenium Standalone

[https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone](https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone)

Command line or programmatic install and launch of selenium standalone server, chrome driver, internet explorer driver, firefox driver and phantomjs

#### Selenium

[http://www.seleniumhq.org](http://www.seleniumhq.org)

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.

## TODO

1 Refactor stages components to "boards".

2 Ensure test specs are using constants where applicable.

3 Implement websocket server online check.  Only attempt comms if it is.

4 Refactor prop types check which has moved to its own module from the React core.
