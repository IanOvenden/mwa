REACT
=====

CAVEATS
 -  React encourages working in an immutable style.
 -  Data flow is one way (Parent > Child)
 -  Components must return a single root element. This is why we added a <div> to contain all the <Welcome /> elements.
 -  Always start component names with a capital letter. 
    For example, <div /> represents a DOM tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
 -  All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
 -  Class components should always call the base constructor with props.
 -  The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.
 -  There should be a single "source of truth" for any data that changes in a React application. 
 -  State in one parent component will often form the properties of child elements. 
 -  jsx html is xhtml based - require self closing tags
 -  Render can only return one element.  Have to wrap child elements.
 -  Keep jsx code light on JS.  Try to keep some semblance of separation of concerns.
 -  Classes called from other classes need to come before them in source code. Easier if in separate files, in terms of maintenance.
 -  Props are immutable - READ ONLY
