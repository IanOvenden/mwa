REACT
=====

CAVEATS
 -  Components must return a single root element. This is why we added a <div> to contain all the <Welcome /> elements.
 -  Always start component names with a capital letter. 
    For example, <div /> represents a DOM tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
 -  All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
 -  Class components should always call the base constructor with props.
 -  The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.
 -  There should be a single "source of truth" for any data that changes in a React application.
